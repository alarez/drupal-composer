# Drupal Composer

This project template provides a starter kit for managing your site dependencies with and it is inspired by 
[this project][drupal-composer]. This is meant as a starting point. Change things as need it.

## Create Project
```bash
composer create-project drupal-settings/drupal-composer project-name
```
Replace `project-name` with the name of the folder or the project

## Quick start
In order to start a new project run:
```bash
fin init
```
This will install the Drupal. If there is an configuration, it will install Drupal with that configuration. 
You only need to run this once.

If you already have drupal install, then run `fin up`. If you need to more about [fin][docksal], go to the [docksal][docksal] documentation
